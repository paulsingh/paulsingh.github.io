Now that I've spent about a week in Pittsburgh, Tulsa, Taos, Los Alamos, Santa Fe and Albuquerque, it's obvious that cities need to provide four basic things if they want to see their local tech-enabled companies to thrive:

1. **Work space.** This could be in the form of a coworking space, an accelerator or an incubator -- it doesn't really matter as long as local entrepreneurs have a place to work and meet that isn't their couch or their local coffee shop. Bonus points if it's run by someone that knows how to build a sense of community.
2. **Event space.** Every industry has groups that meet up on a regular basis, tech-enabled companies are no different. There are bound to be web design, marketing, and similar groups that will form. They might be small at first but they'll need a place to meet. 
3. **Code School.** As local companies grow, hiring becomes a challenge. At first, local companies will turn to hiring remote employees and/or moving candidates from elsewhere to their HQ. Over time, it's important for communities to develop their own local talent too -- particularly adults that might not have the time or interest in going back to college to learn technology skills.
4. **Capital.** Whether it's through venture capital firms, angel groups, local banks or some other source -- money's important, especially for companies that find themselves limited by their existing cash flow.
