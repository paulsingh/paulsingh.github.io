This post was inspired by a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/washdctech/permalink/403765963002176/" target="_blank">discussion on Facebook</a> where I started a comment with this: in 2012+, why does it matter where anyone&#8217;s located anymore?

It used to be that startups had to chase the money/investors and, because travel was usually expensive, they had to look in their backyard or move elsewhere. These days, that balance has shifted: cross-country flights can be obtained for <$500 roundtrip and **capital is following the talent, regardless of location**. In the case of 500 Startups, we&#8217;re deploying everywhere &#8211; domestic and international &#8211; and you&#8217;re going to see even more investors like us over the next 3-5 years.

So, here&#8217;s a thought for the founders out there: **focus on building the best business you can &#8211; regardless of where you&#8217;re located**. The money will find you, I can promise you of that.<!--more-->

**Founders \*shouldn&#8217;t\* be wasting time consciously trying to make their city better &#8211; they should focus on building fantastic businesses** that will attract other founders to do the same. After all, hackers attract hackers.

Leave the city/regional stuff to investors and politicians &#8211; not because they&#8217;re better at building community but because they&#8217;ll be \*forced\* to figure it out when the smartest founders start threatening to leave (or when savvy investors try to lure the best startups away).
