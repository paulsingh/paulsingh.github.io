I have a friend that recently bought a used car *at full price*. His excuse: &#8220;I asked for a discount but they didn&#8217;t give it to me *so I gave up*.&#8221; Sure, he could probably stand to learn a little bit about better negotiating but there *is* a better way to get a better deal.

It&#8217;s no secret that most people have a hard time talking about money &#8212; just look at how many bloggers write about ways to ask for raises at work or save $100 on your next purchase. Sure, it&#8217;s great if people use the advice but most people won&#8217;t, so why keep beating the proverbial dead horse?

The point is not to avoid asking for the discount but to know *exactly* what to do when that tactic fails.

### The art of asking for *more*

Next time you&#8217;re negotiating, try asking for more.<!--more--> I use this tactic when buying cars, dealing with vendors or bargaining with street merchants 

*and it works every time* &#8212; despite what you might believe, most businesses would much rather give you something more than reduce the price. When your request gets shot down, don&#8217;t walk away pissed off &#8212; **ask for something more**: get them to throw in something else. (Tip: If you&#8217;re buying a car, you can usually get floor mats and your first few service visits absolutely free &#8212; ask for them after you think you&#8217;ve gotten the price as low as you can go.)

### What businesses are thinking

At a 10% discount, a typical firm would need to sell 50% more units to keep the same profit on the bottom-line. Costs also increase in the &#8220;discount&#8221; game, so companies can literally discount themselves out of business. Instead of cutting cash out of the deal, they&#8217;d rather add value to whatever you&#8217;re buying &#8212; this &#8220;value added&#8221; proposition means they can &#8220;give away&#8221; something that won&#8217;t come out their profits. Done right, it adda to the customer&#8217;s experience and that&#8217;s the key to getting that customer back.

### Oh, and one more thing

Use this tip when you&#8217;re negotiating your next pay raise. If the conversation gets bogged down before you get to the number you want, start asking for other perks instead &#8212; extra vacation days, telecommuting perks or educational reimbursements. It&#8217;s all fair game.
