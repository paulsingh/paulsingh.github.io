Jason Cohen&#8217;s analysis of <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/marketplace-business-model.html" target="_blank">&#8220;marketplace&#8221; business models</a> is fantastic, but this gem is the most important:

> **But just because automation is the goal doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s the way to start.** The good thing about automation is it&#8217;s efficient; the bad thing is **you cannot learn** because you&#8217;re not involved in the process. And at the start, learning is where you *should* be spending most of your time!
> 
> For example, when <a title="Company home page" href="http://www.sparefoot.com/" target="_blank">SpareFoot</a> began they weren&#8217;t sure how to charge storage companies. Should it be a $20/month listing fee? Or a flat &#8220;finders fee&#8221; per lead? Or a commission on leads which convert to sales? Could they charge extra for a &#8220;premium&#8221; listing? Should purchases go through SpareFoot so they can extract their cut, or should they bill storage companies separately?
> 
> If they had picked a strategy and automated it, there&#8217;s a low chance they would have picked the right one. All that time spent writing and debugging code, worthless.
> 
> Instead SpareFoot decided to automate *nothing*. When a potential buyer made a search, they grabbed their email or phone number and said &#8220;Thanks, we&#8217;re going to find you a great deal by Thursday.&#8221; Then they banged the phone all day, calling up regional storage facilities. Their pitch was awesome: &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a lead for you; his name is John Doe and he&#8217;s looking for a 10&#215;20 with air conditioning. If your rate is competitive, we can do the deal today. **By the way, if you want us to send leads like this to you all the time, it&#8217;s $20/mo to list with us.**&#8221;
> 
> The bold phrase in there is damn compelling, right? And of course they varied the offer based on current pricing theory or in real-time based on the interaction with that particular storage facility.
> 
> None of this — determining the pricing structure and amount, building relationships with facility managers, and ensuring buyers&#8217; success — would have happened if they started by writing code or any other sort of automation.

When I started MailFinch, I did everything manually &#8212; printing, folding, stuffing, licking, stamping, addressing&#8230; *everything*. When I was ready to start scaling, I knew the pain points better than anyone else. Scaling was the easy part.
