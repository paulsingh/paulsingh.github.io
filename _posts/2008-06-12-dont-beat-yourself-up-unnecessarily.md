<span style="font-style: italic;">This is the seventh in a series of posts about the <a href="http://www.resultsjunkies.com/blog/some-lessons-i-wish-i-learned-earlier-in-life/">lessons I wish I’d learned earlier in life</a>.</span>

There&#8217;s a (big) difference between beating yourself up and being honest with yourself. The problem is, most of us choose to beat ourselves up more than we should &#8211; it&#8217;s all in the language we use.

Sometimes we get down on ourselves for &#8220;slacking off&#8221; or procrastinating, when in reality we are thinking through a tough decision. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=vsMLV4mG0M4C&dq=the+procrastinator%27s+guide+to+success&pg=PP1&ots=FAQ9eXDGAW&sig=dnKMqT1cKTptlXj05csdD9U8oSk&hl=en&prev=http://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3Dthe%2Bprocrastinator%2527s%2Bguide%2Bto%2Bsuccess&sa=X&oi=print&ct=title&cad=one-book-with-thumbnail#PPA6,M1" target="_blank">The Procrastinator&#8217;s Guide to Success</a>, author Lynn Lively reassuringly notes that if you feel uncertain, confused, overwhelmed, and clueless on how to proceed (we all have those moments!), then you&#8217;re not procrastinating; you&#8217;re a person who is considering options in order to make the best possible decision. Starting to feel better about yourself yet?

If you spend a little time putting a positive spin on all your actions, it will become second nature, and you&#8217;ll soon find that you&#8217;re more productive. How, you ask? Think of it this way: Every moment you spend worrying about the past is a moment you could spend learning from your mistakes so that you can become a better (and more successful) person.

We could all take a lesson from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison" target="_blank">Thomas Edison</a>, who struggled through more than 10,000 unsuccessful attempts to create the first light bulb before he finally got it right. Imagine if he&#8217;d wasted his time dwelling on his so-called &#8220;failures&#8221; or (even worse) if he&#8217;d called himself a failure and given up; who knows how long mankind would&#8217;ve been left in the dark.

</p>

So the next time you hit a stumbling block, note what went wrong, make the appropriate changes, and celebrate the fact that you&#8217;re one step closer to your goal.

As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Welch" target="_blank">Jack Welch</a> put it:

> Don&#8217;t beat yourself up if you get it wrong some of the time, especially when you&#8217;re starting out. Just remember, it&#8217;s your mistake to fix.

And that&#8217;s the key: As long as you recognize the mistake and take action to correct it, move on. Life&#8217;s too short to beat yourself up anyways.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>How you can make this work for you: </strong>Take a good, hard look at a recent mistake that you&#8217;re beating yourself up over. Instead of focusing on the negative, stop and think about the good that came from the experience. Did you walk away with a better understanding of how to handle a similar situation the next time it rolls around? Did you learn a new skill? Look for the silver lining, and commit yourself to taking something positive from everything you do.
