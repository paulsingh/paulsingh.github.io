Putting all of your eggs in a single basket is never a good idea &#8211; the problem is that too many of us do it anyways. Worse, many people seem to think that all it takes is &#8220;one good idea&#8221; to make millions. These people are crazy &#8211; you should ignore them.

On a side note, it always makes me laugh when Indian people use Bill Gates and Donald Trump as the standard by which success is measured. (Anyone that grew up in an Indian household knows what I&#8217;m talking about.)

A post over at [Self Made Chick][1] nails the idea (I&#8217;ve added the emphasis):

> But I think that chasing “millions” of dollars may be one of the reasons why many people never even make $1 online. **Instead of focusing on the few ways to make millions of dollars online, perhaps it is more profitable to pursue one of the millions of ways to make hundreds or thousands of dollars online.**<!--more-->

> I think that with gurus tossing around huge million dollar sales figures, many of us have developed a mindset that if something isn’t going to make millions of dollars that it’s not worth pursuing. $3,000 may not be a million dollars, but it’s nothing to scoff at. A few thousand dollars can greatly enhance the quality of your life. $3,000 can buy:
> 
>   * A 10% down payment on a 2008 128I RWD 2-Dr Coupe L6
>   * A 7 day Mediterranean cruise for 2 with a balcony view
>   * A semester of in-state college tuition in many states
>   * A 42″ flat screen TV and complete surround sound system
>   * Freedom from $3,000 worth of credit card debt

A friend of mine has been talking about opening up his own bar for *years*. The funny thing is that if you ask him why he hasn&#8217;t done it yet, he&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s just not enough money in it. I want to make millions!&#8221; *Oh really?* Let me get this straight: once you&#8217;ve got it running, brought on a bartenders to cover the bar, hired a manager, you won&#8217;t be able to work on other things while bringing in a small profit?

Maybe a bar is a bad example, but the point is that you should *just get started*. It&#8217;s really that simple.
