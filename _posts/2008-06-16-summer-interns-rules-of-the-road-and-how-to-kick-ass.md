I feel old. It&#8217;s summer and interns are all over the place.

Although I was an intern for only one summer long, long ago &#8211; I&#8217;ve undoubtedly known a number of friends that have experienced multiple internships. As with most workplaces, I&#8217;ve seen some come away with an enriched vision that could only be obtained through rewarding work with talented professionals while others have left disappointed, frustrated or much, much worse.

I&#8217;m going to share the rules of the road that summer interns should live and breathe &#8211; follow them and you&#8217;ll save yourself some embarrassment and start impressing your new coworkers. Get to it:

  1. **Observe firstâ€”then speak.** You&#8217;re an intern for a reason. Do I really need to explain this further?
  2. **Aim high.** You&#8217;ve got a *real* job now. While the rest of your friends fold clothes at the latest department store, you&#8217;re starting your professional career. Go you.
  3. **Introduce yourself to others.** That&#8217;s right: I don&#8217;t know you and I probably deleted the email announcing your arrival. Make the most of your bathroom breaks, copy machine runs and [TPS report][1] deliveries &#8211; say hello to people on the way.
  4. **Set goals**. You&#8217;re going to report on Project XYZ every Monday. While you&#8217;re at it, you&#8217;ll be reporting on Project ABC every Wednesday. You get the idea -** **become the always-gets-things-done kid. Listen, there&#8217;ll be plenty of grunt work; get that done, efficiently and professionally, then focus on the real reason you&#8217;re here.
  5. **Ask for work.** There&#8217;s nothing greater than an intern that *asks* to get involved in projects. Sure, do the work that your boss assigns you but don&#8217;t be shy when you hear about a project that interests you.
  6. **Attend every meeting.** Every. Single. One. While you&#8217;re at it, go to every lunch that you&#8217;re invited to. (Best practice: If invited for a date, *don&#8217;t go*.) It&#8217;s the best way to learn how a business works. There&#8217;s no better way to learn about office politics, decision making, interpersonal communication and management hierarchies.
  7. **Come prepared to work, well rested, and ready.** Seriously, no one cares that you were out, like, drinking and, like, hanging out with hotties. You&#8217;re working with professionals now, start acting like one.
  8. **Make friends with everyone, equally.** Sure, make a list of everyone you&#8217;re dying to meet and go knock on their doors; if they&#8217;re not in their offices, pop them an e-mailed hello. Don&#8217;t discriminate: the new employee that no one knows might be the one to tip you off about a job opening next year.
  9. **Get over yourself.** An internship is an *opportunity*. You were good enough to get hired, so give yourself a pat on the back but now it&#8217;s time gain experience. Be a sponge. Take every assignment. Attend every event. Who cares if you look like an ass? This isn&#8217;t the time to play it cool.
 10. **Figure out who the &#8216;stars&#8217; are and do what they do.** This is the *most* important tip &#8211; memorize it. These people have done all the hard work for you, all you need to do is mimic them. What could be easier?

Remember: You&#8217;re going to get ahead by working your ass off and showing up for everything.

That&#8217;s it &#8211; now get back to work. Someday, when you&#8217;re my new boss, please don&#8217;t forget that I helped you succeed in your first internship. So work hard and have a great summer. Now go get me a coffee, *intern*!
