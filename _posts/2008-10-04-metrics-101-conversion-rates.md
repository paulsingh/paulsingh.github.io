It&#8217;s interesting to watch an increasing number of mom & pop small businesses get online these days. There&#8217;s been no shortage of design shops and independent contractors that will charge a few hundred bucks to slap together some images and put up a website for you. Is it really worth it?

Unfortunately, most people have absolutely no idea how to determine whether they actually get any real value out of having a website. Let&#8217;s fix that today: read on for a crash course in measuring your website&#8217;s success.<!--more-->

## **What&#8217;s a Conversion Point?**

Whenever a visitor to your website makes a choice, a *conversion point* exists that generates two metrics:

  1. **Cost of Conversion.** For the sake of this article, we&#8217;ll skip over this particular metric &#8212; just realize that it exists and is an important metric to keep track of when you decide to start paying to generate traffic (via online and offline methods).
  2. **Rate of Conversion.**

The key is to identify your business&#8217; significant conversion points which, if chosen most often by visitors, will lead to the achievement of your goals. (More on this in future posts.)

### Conversion Rate

Google&#8217;s dictionary defines a conversion rate as &#8220;the number of visitors who took a desired action divided by the total number of visitors in a given time period (typically, per month).&#8221;

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Formula:</strong> Desired Action / Total Visitors = Conversion Rate
</p>

For example, if 1,000 unique visitors were driven to your website from a search engine and 10 of those visitors signed up for your newsletter, then your newsletter conversion rate would be 1.0%. (As a rule of thumb, you should be shooting for a conversion rate of at least 2%.)

In general, a conversion rate is calculated whenever a desired action occurs by a visitor to your website. The most crucial conversion rates are those directly associated with the achievement of your business&#8217; goals.

Examples include:

  * A visitor types in their email address and clicks &#8220;submit&#8221; to join your newsletter.
  * A visitor subscribes to your blog via RSS or email.
  * A visitor clicks their browser&#8217;s &#8220;back&#8221; button to leave your website.
  * A visitor buys your product.

### **The most important metric: Sales Conversion Rate**

For most businesses, sales are the lifeblood of the company. Without them, nothing else really matters anyways.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Formula:</strong> # of Sales / Total Visitors = Sales Conversion Rate
</p>

For example, if the 1,000 unique visitors generated 20 sales, then your sales conversion rate is 2%.

  So, what does this really mean?

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Rather than simply putting up your website and blindly waiting for customers, you should be constantly tracking your conversion rates. (Tip: <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> is a free, easy way to automate the tracking and reporting.)
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>As a rule of thumb, you should constantly aim for a conversion rate of around 2% (or higher).</strong> Anything lower, it&#8217;s time to start testing new ideas to raise this number. If you&#8217;re already at 2%, it&#8217;s time to dig a bit deeper into the newsletter, RSS and other conversion rates and see where things can be improved further.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Spend your the vast majority of your time increasing conversion rates &#8212; this is the most effective use of your time. Simplify your decision making: If you&#8217;re working on something that isn&#8217;t improving your conversion rates, stop and move on to the next thing.
