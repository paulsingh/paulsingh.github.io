An article in this month&#8217;s Inc. magazine challenged A.G. Lafley, CEO of Procter & Gamble and Ram Charan to take on a toy company with $4 million in revenue and 30 employees. The result was a [seven-step routine for innovation][1]:

  1. **Select the strategy:** Looking for an underserved market.
  2. **Connect to customers:** The social network as idea collector.
  3. **Generate ideas:** Brain-storming done right.
  4. **Select an idea:** Time to separate the good from the great.
  5. **Prototype and test:** Bring on the customers.
  6. **Go to market:** Cookies versus cookie dough.
  7. **Adjust for growth:** The process evolves.

One line especially jumped out at me because it applies to you and me:

> <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">It&#8217;s not about brilliance. Valuable new ideas are the product of hard work and smart, disciplined processes.</span>

I&#8217;ve read a couple of Ram&#8217;s books but two of my favorites are [&#8220;Profitable Growth Is Everyone&#8217;s Business: 10 Tools You Can Use Monday Morning&#8221;][2] and [&#8220;What the CEO Wants You to Know : How Your Company Really Works&#8221;][3]. Definitely worth picking up.
