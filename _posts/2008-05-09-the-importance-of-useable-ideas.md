A friend of mine called me out of the blue a few months ago, here&#8217;s how the conversation went:

> Me: &#8220;Hey man, how&#8217;s it going?&#8221;  
> Him: &#8220;Great! Listen, I know you&#8217;re busy but I want to start a business&#8221;  
> Me: &#8220;Ok.&#8221;  
> Him: &#8220;Where do I start?&#8221;  
> Me: &#8220;Uh, what kind of business?&#8221;  
> Him: &#8220;You tell me!&#8221;  
> Me: &#8220;I&#8217;m hanging up now.&#8221;

First, let me say that I love helping people succeed. I really do. But for the love of all that is holy, please spend a second (or three) to make sure that you&#8217;ve got a *useable* idea before you pitch it to someone.

Ideas are worthless unless you can make them into something useful. Your most incredible idea can turn into a stupid one if the idea simply isn&#8217;t doable. I&#8217;ve had a few of these. Chances are, you&#8217;ve had some too.

What makes an entrepreneur great isn&#8217;t the actually greatness of the idea, but **the ability to make it happen**.
