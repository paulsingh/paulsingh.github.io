    A few weeks ago, I opened up my RSS reader of choice (NetNewsWire, actually) to quickly scan the titles of the new posts available and mark the rest as &#8220;read&#8221; immediately. Total time spent: 5 minutes. Total value gained: 0. I needed to find a better way to filter my feeds or risk contuining this daily charade.

    There&#8217;s no doubt that RSS (and Twitter) have become essential to the online experience, we&#8217;re all getting busier and the amount of information we get bombarded with increases (<em>exponentially?</em>) on a daily basis. What we really need is a tool to help us manage the increasing amount of information we&#8217;re dealing with so we can get some of our precious time back.

    The existing market for RSS readers and Twitter clients is huge, however there&#8217;s not much out there that actually tries to save you some time. In fact, I haven&#8217;t found a single client that can single-handedly reduce my Twitter & RSS overload. I want to change all that with something that is simple to use, fun to use and makes life easy again. That&#8217;s why I created <a href="http://www.philtro.com" target="_blank">Philtro</a>.<!--more-->

    So, what does it do?
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.philtro.com" target="_blank">Philtro</a> lets you rate articles and tweets so you can find the most interesting, relevant posts first. <strong>It&#8217;s like a spam filter for your RSS & Twitter subscriptions.</strong> <a href="http://www.philtro.com" target="_blank">Philtro</a> helps you sort through hundreds of posts to find the ones you want to read. Just signup, add your Twitter account and/or RSS feeds and start rating your stuff. <a href="http://www.philtro.com" target="_blank">Philtro</a> takes care of the rest.

    Just under two weeks ago, I launched a private beta version of Philtro and starting receiving great feedback from the early testers. (Thanks everyone!) I&#8217;ve been rolling out bugfixes and improving Philtro on a daily basis but it&#8217;s time to start spreading the word. <strong>If you or anyone else you know is overwhelmed by their RSS or Twitter feeds, <a href="http://www.philtro.com" target="_blank">signup for the Philtro beta</a>!</strong>
