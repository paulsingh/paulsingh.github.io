Chris Dixon recently wrote about <a href="http://cdixon.org/2012/05/26/the-experience-economy/" target="_blank">the experience economy</a> and this particular part caught my eye:

> The [era][1] of competing over technical specifications is over. Users want better experiences from devices, applications, websites, and the offline services they enable. It is no coincidence that interaction design is [replacing][2] technical prowess as the primary competency at startups.

I totally agree with the first part of the statement but fundamentally disagree with the last sentence above. **Interaction design isn&#8217;t replacing technical prowess, it&#8217;s requiring startups to have even more of it.** After all, those sexy interfaces aren&#8217;t going to build themselves.
