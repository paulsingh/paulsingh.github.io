It&#8217;s been a week since Summit Series wrapped up and I&#8217;m finally getting around to processing all of the fantastic conversations I had through the weekend. My favorite people at the event, by far, were the entrepreneurs with a pure *tactical* mindset. Anyone talking strategy was usually shutdown by a simple tactical question that involved specific calls to action, conversion rates and tools. I loved it.<!--more-->

The harsh reality of entrepreneurship is that successes (whether you&#8217;re thinking in terms of revenue, user counts or anything else) are few and far between &#8212; for every one that succeeded, there were ten others that failed. **Building strong businesses is about consistently hitting <a href="http://www.resultsjunkies.com/blog/singles-and-doubles-using-metrics-to-grow-your-business/" target="_blank">singles and doubles</a>.**

By learning how to consistently hit these singles and doubles, these entrepreneurs set themselves up to knock a home run out of the park.

Hand-wavy strategies are overrated. Pick a few core metrics (signups, conversion rates, etc), use tactical techniques (A/B testing, landing pages, better calls-to-action, etc) to make the numbers even better and, *most importantly*, block off time on a monthly basis to review the previous month&#8217;s results and make decisions about the next month.
