<span style="font-style: italic;">This is the eighth in a series of posts about the <a href="../blog/some-lessons-i-wish-i-learned-earlier-in-life/">lessons I wish I’d learned earlier in life</a>.</span>

I was talking to a friend of mine last week and somehow we got on the topic of a new business idea. A few minutes later, he cut me off and declared, &#8220;This is *never* going to work. It takes money to make money and I don&#8217;t have much of that.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t sure how to respond so I asked him why he&#8217;d turned negative all of a sudden. His response: &#8220;I&#8217;m not being negative &#8211; I&#8217;m being *realistic*.&#8221;

I&#8217;ve heard that before.

Here&#8217;s the thing though &#8211; find all the negative people you know and ask them about their attitudes. You&#8217;ll notice that they never view themselves as negative people.

What I&#8217;ve noticed is that negative people tend to adopt a defeatist mindset while positive people focus on creating opportunities. It&#8217;s also interesting to note that you don&#8217;t see a whole lot of successful people with a negative outlook on life. People who are focused on the negative almost always find a way to talk themselves out of pursuing interesting opportunities.<!--more-->

For a moment, let&#8217;s pretend that I&#8217;m going to *give* you a business idea that you think is great. Which response are you more likely to have?

**Response &#8220;A&#8221;:** &#8220;Starting a new business is too expensive. I have a mortgage, a car payment, blah blah blah. I can&#8217;t afford to shell out any additional money right now for start-up costs. I certainly don&#8217;t want to give up any of the fun money I stash away for entertainment and boozing!&#8221;  
**Response &#8220;B&#8221;**: &#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll cut out my morning latte and a few meals out each week for a while to free up money in my budget. Small sacrifices now will be well worth it after I&#8217;ve put in the hard work and can watch my new idea grow.&#8221;

Now, which response is more likely to get you ahead?

If you find that you tend to lean toward the negative, [don&#8217;t beat yourself up][1]. Change your attitude up &#8211; start focusing on creating opportunities for yourself and the rest will take care of itself.
