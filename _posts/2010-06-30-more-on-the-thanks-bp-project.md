A few days ago, I quietly launched a way for people to <a href="https://www.mailfinch.com/thanksbp" target="_blank">donate to the Gulf cleanup while taking a jab at BP</a>. We sold ten letters in the first few minutes and it&#8217;s steadily grown over the past few days &#8212; yesterday, we <a href="http://twitter.com/BPGlobalPR/status/17367941837" target="_blank">won the #bpcarescontest</a>.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923" title="bpcarescontest winner" src="http://www.resultsjunkies.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/bpcarescontest-winner.png" alt="" width="533" height="262" />][1]

I started the <a href="https://www.mailfinch.com/thanksbp" target="_blank">MailFinch &#8220;Thanks BP&#8221; project</a> because I wanted to do something more than just donate to the cleanup. I wanted to get back at BP&#8230; ideally, without getting sued in the process. It turns out, other people wanted to do the same thing too.

As I write this, we&#8217;ve sold over 100 letters in the past few hours (incidentally, the &#8220;<a href="https://www.mailfinch.com/thanksbp#pelican" target="_blank">BP-covered Pelican</a>&#8221; is the #1 favorite by a *huge* margin) and the orders keep rolling in &#8212; **every penny we make on this will be donated to the <a href="http://healthygulf.org/" target="_blank">Gulf Restoration Network</a>**.

> When I see an oil-covered pelican on the news, I don&#8217;t say to myself, &#8220;That&#8217;s an oily scum-covered pelican.&#8221; No. I say to myself, &#8220;That&#8217;s a BP-covered pelican.&#8221;

So, do your part: donate to the cleanup, tell your friends about this or *just do something*. It&#8217;s our responsibility to make sure this doesn&#8217;t happen anywhere else on the planet.
