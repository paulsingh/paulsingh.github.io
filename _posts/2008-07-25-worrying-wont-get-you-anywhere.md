  <span style="color: #353535;">This is a big one so listen to me carefully: <strong>Most things you fear will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> actually happen.</strong> Even if they do, they&#8217;re never as painful or bad as you expected. So, I&#8217;ve learned that worrying about stuff is just a waste of time. </span>

  <span style="color: #353535;">This is, of course, easy to say. But if you remind yourself of how little of what you feared throughout your life has actually happened, you&#8217;ll probably end up laughing at yourself. (I know I did.)</span> Now think about how much time you&#8217;ve <em>wasted</em> worrying about trivial things.

  How my friend and I used to waste time:
</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13pt;" align="left">
  I have a friend who&#8217;s been interviewing for a few jobs recently.<!--more--> She&#8217;s experienced, talented, knows all the right people and has great interviewing skills. The problem is that she nails herself after the interview and starts worrying about everything. In fact, she&#8217;ll sit there and 
  
  <em>constantly</em> check her cell phone for a call back. A week goes by before she hears anything back but she wasted a whole week! (She got the job she wanted anyways.)
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13pt;" align="left">
  When I started this blog a few months ago, I constantly worried about whether visitors would actually care about anything I had to say. Whenever a new post went up, I&#8217;d spend nearly the <em>whole next day</em> watching the statistics. And for what? What I didn&#8217;t understand at the time was that it simply doesn&#8217;t matter. What does matter is that I keep blogging and dealing with all the other things I&#8217;ve got going on.
</p>

<h2 class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13pt;">
  &#8220;But, I&#8217;m still worried!&#8221;

  <em>Fine.</em> First, you need to get some self discipline. (Need some <a href="http://www.resultsjunkies.com/coaching/">outside motivation</a>?) Second, <strong>go do something else</strong>. Seriously, if you just can&#8217;t get the worries out of your mind, at least put your energy into something useful.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13pt;" align="left">
  <h2 class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13pt;">
    The bottom line:
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    You probably have tons of other stuff to do.
  </p>
  
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13pt;" align="left">
    Stop making excuses. Worrying isn&#8217;t going to solve anything anyways. Start spending your time working on other things. When and if something bad actually happens, just get started on the solution. Seriously, it works.
