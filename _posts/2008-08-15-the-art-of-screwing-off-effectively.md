Whether you&#8217;re working for someone else or running your own gig, you&#8217;re probably going to slack off at some point. I should know, I do it and so do most of the people I know. Unfortunately, efficiently wasting time remains a complex, underestimated and often misunderstood task.

In my experience, some of my *most productive* moments occur when I take a break and waste a little time.

Just remember that there&#8217;s a fine line between using your downtime effectively and stealing time or resources from your employer, family or friends. First and foremost, if you&#8217;re getting paid to do a job, that work needs to be your top priority. Don&#8217;t forget about your family either.

With that being said, there are some ways to use your legitimate downtime to focus on getting ahead.<!--more-->

  1. **Exercise:** This is the *best* way to spend your down time. A good workout gets your mind off of things and gets your body in shape at the same time. Try to get into a routine of working out at least 2-3 times a week for 30 minutes &#8212; it&#8217;s easier than you think and you&#8217;ll probably gain some new perspectives on yourself in the process.
  2. **Change your environment:** A change in scenery is well worth the effort. It can be as simple as heading over to a new coffee shop or taking a weekend getaway. Putting yourself into new situations tends to give you a new perspective on things.
  3. **Read a book:** There&#8217;s nothing like holding a book in your hands and flipping through the pages. Pick up a book from time to time and get a new perspective on things. I&#8217;ve been picking up books from the [Personal MBA&#8217;s recommended reading list][1] and running through them on the weekends.
  4. **Go offline:** This can be as effective as you want it to be. Some people simply turn off their laptop while others ditch technology for the weekend and go cold turkey. Personally, [I&#8217;ll grab my notebook & trusty pen][2] and head off to a local coffee shop. Using a nice pen and paper is much more relaxing than you might think &#8212; seeing your thoughts on paper tends to help you see them from a totally different perspective.
  5. **Take a Nap:** This is a tough one &#8212; I&#8217;ve found it hard to not feel guilty for taking a nap in the middle of the day. Despite what you may think, your body needs rest from time to time. Don&#8217;t feel bad for taking a 15 minute nap on the couch. You&#8217;ll bounce back with more energy than you think.

So, continue screwing off &#8212; just make it worthwhile in the process. If you&#8217;ve got any other ideas on how to effectively waste time, I&#8217;d love to hear about them in the comments!
