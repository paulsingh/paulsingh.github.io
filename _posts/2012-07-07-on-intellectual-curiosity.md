I used to carpool to elementary school with a classmate that lived nearby. I remember only one thing from all those years: her dad would tell me anything I wanted to know as long as I asked a question. (Mr. Clayton, where are you these days anyways?)

I went to a small private school and was generally OK with being &#8220;the nerd&#8221; around my neighborhood. I&#8217;m a terribly slow learner when it comes to traditional classroom instruction, but I&#8217;m a sponge when someone answers a question of mine &#8212; more importantly, I love learning stuff on my own. I like scratching my own itch. It&#8217;s probably not the most efficient way to learn something new, but it&#8217;s worked pretty well for me.

I&#8217;ve met a lot of people over the past few months and I&#8217;m starting to realize something: **you can&#8217;t teach intellectual curiosity**. You might be able to inspire or briefly encourage it, but **you can&#8217;t force people to be genuinely interested in learning new things**.
