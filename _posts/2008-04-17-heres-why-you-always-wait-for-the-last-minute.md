Anyone remember getting assigned a project in school? You&#8217;d think to yourself, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got plenty of time, it&#8217;s not due for 6 weeks!&#8221; Then, before you know it, you&#8217;re cramming in the entire project on the night before it&#8217;s due. (I was a *master* of this throughout my school years.

Parkinson’s Law simply states that “work will fill the time available for its completion.” As Tim Ferriss puts it in his latest book, [The Four Hour Workweek][1] (buy it now, you&#8217;ll thank me):

> If I give you a week to complete the same task, it&#8217;s six days of making a mountain out of a molehill. If I give you two months, God forbid, it becomes a mental monster. The end product of the shorter deadline is almost inevitably of equal or higher quality due to greater focus.
> 
> This presents a very curious phenomenon. There are two synergistic approaches for increasing productivity that are inversions of one another:
> 
> 1.) Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time. (80/20)  
> 2.) Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important. (Parkinson&#8217;s Law).
> 
> The best solution is to use both together: Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income and schedule them with *very short* and clear deadlines.

The idea is to apply [the 80/20 rule][2] to your to-do list first. Once you&#8217;ve determined what you really need to get done, start setting deadlines for each of the remaining things &#8211; and stick to them.

(Personal Tip: I set the countdown timer on my iPhone to 60 minutes each time I sit down. When the time runs out, I move on to the next thing on my list &#8211; no questions asked. I&#8217;ve found that, most of the time, I tend to finish the task within the time. If it didn&#8217;t get finished, I leave it on my list and get back to it after working through the next to-do items.)
