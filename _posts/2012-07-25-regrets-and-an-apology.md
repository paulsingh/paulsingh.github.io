**There are few things in life that you can do to potentially change the world** and [500 Startups is one of them][1]. Though, this kind of opportunity comes with it&#8217;s own burdens: we&#8217;re a relatively small team that bootstrapped it&#8217;s way to 350+ investments in nearly 20 countries now. On any given day, we&#8217;re collectively fielding hundreds of emails from existing portfolio companies and hopeful entrepreneurs.

My time here has been so rewarding and I&#8217;d do it again if given the opportunity. But,Â **I regret that I haven&#8217;t figured out a way to stay on top of things in both my personal and professional life**: I&#8217;ve lost touch with old friends, thrown wrenches into my personal relationships and left more than a few current/future founders hanging while they wait for me to catch up on email and phone calls.

So, **consider this my public apology to anyone that&#8217;s felt unimportant because of my actions (or lack thereof) &#8212; that&#8217;s not the case at all**. I&#8217;m doing the best I can and, one day, I hope to make it up to all of you for being so incredibly patient with me.
