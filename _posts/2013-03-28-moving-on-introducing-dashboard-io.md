It&#8217;s been a wild and crazy ride here at 500 Startups: over the last few years, I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to work with some of the smartest people I&#8217;ve ever met, fund hundreds of ambitious founders from all over the world and help build a fantastic venture firm. Now it&#8217;s time to step back from my day-to-day responsibilities here at 500 and focus on something new. Well, maybe not so new&#8230;<!--more-->

The foundation of 500 Startups is our community of mentors, founders and their teams. We originally used products like Google Groups to bring the community together but, as with most email lists, it simply became untenable once we scaled past a few hundred people in the network. In the process, I began building tools to allow our portfolio to interact with each other via discussions/comments, office hours and private messages.

I call this platform [dashboard.io][1] and it is a platform for funded startups to connect with and benchmark against their investors’ portfolios. Hundreds of funded startups use the platform daily to connect with the larger network of founders, employees and mentors within networks like 500 Startups, TechStars, Y Combinator, Startup Chile, Seedcamp and more.

Starting today, we&#8217;re going to begin releasing it to the networks of other investors &#8212; **you can signup via AngelList here: [dashboard.io][1]**

(P.S. you should [follow dashboard.io on AngelList][2].)
