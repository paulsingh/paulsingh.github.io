Demo days are a funny thing. Everyone seems to think it&#8217;s about bringing startups and investors together but my observation is that many of these events turn out to be nothing more than a social event for investors (and wanna-be investors) to catch up with each other. **If you&#8217;re the startup trying to raise money at your demo day event, you&#8217;re a sucker.** Smart founders use demo days as forcing functions when they&#8217;re [generating heat for their startup][1].

I&#8217;ve been to a number of demo days over the past few years and helped host ours here at 500. A couple of observations for both founders and the good people that run these events:<!--more-->

### Founders

<div>
  If you remember nothing else, your #1 goal in fundraising (and in life) is: <strong>don&#8217;t be weird</strong>. People invest in other people, despite what you might have read elsewhere.

Some additional tips:

  * **Keep the pitch tight, three minutes is the max.** Your pitch is traction, problem and solution &#8211; in that order. If you finish early, you&#8217;re a winner. Remember that the goal of the presentation is to get the meeting, not to convince them to invest from the comfort of their chair.
  * **If you&#8217;re looking for sample decks and *real* pitch videos, check out out slideshare.net/500startups and livestream.com/500startups.** We post everything there within ~24 hour of our events so you&#8217;ll always have the latest stuff.
  * **Practice, practice, practice.** At 500 Startups, it&#8217;s not uncommon for presenters to go through 40 hours of practice (usually in 3 hour blocks over the course of 2-3 weeks).
  * **If your team is hanging out together during the demo day, you&#8217;re doing it wrong.** Spread out, engage the audience and bring &#8216;em back to the person leading the fundraising for your team.
  * When in doubt, **tag team with someone from \*another\* startup.** Talk each other up, it&#8217;s much more refreshing to an investor than pitching your own startup. Bonus points if you pair up with someone that&#8217;s at a startup that has already raised money from known investors.
  * **Don&#8217;t waste space on your** **slides.** Make sure your twitter handle and/or email (always founders@COMPANY.com to keep things simple) address are in the headers of every slide.** **Don&#8217;t thank people at the end of your pitch, make your ask instead.
  * **Get commitments for your round *before* demo day.** Ideally, you want to close your pitch with something like &#8220;We&#8217;re raising $X and Y% is committed. Come talk to us afterwards if you&#8217;d like to be involved.&#8221;
  * **Don&#8217;t spend more than 15 minutes with any one investor during the event.** Setup a coffee meeting for the next day, but work the room during the event.

### People Running The Show

<div>
  If you&#8217;re brave enough to put on an event to bring founders and investors together, you deserve a pat on the back (and probably a few beers). At the end of the day, you should spend an awful lot of time thinking about how to incentivize both founders and investors to <em>want</em> to meet each other.
</div>

&nbsp;

  * **Invest in quality AV. **No awkward silences: use music for the transitions, preferably upbeat music that the presenters choose and get a DJ to handle the transitions between mics and music. You&#8217;ll make liven up the event, keep people&#8217;s energy high and it&#8217;s the easiest way to make the event more polished. 
      * Pro tip: USE MUSIC FOR THE TRANSITIONS BETWEEN PRESENTERS. I really can&#8217;t stress this enough &#8212; it&#8217;s hard to describe but you&#8217;ll know what I mean when you see it.
  * **Be ruthless on the invite list **- priority goes to investors that have written checks in the recent past. Your startups will notice. The investors in the audience will notice. Everyone will be much happier. 
      * If a founder crashes your demo day, keep them out. Each one you let in will mean one less conversation that your presenting founders will get to have with meaningful investors.
      * If an investor crashes your demo day, require them to show you their AngelList profile. It sets the right tone before they walk in the door.
  * **Each type of attendee should have a different colored name badge.** One for staff, one for press, one for investors, one for founders&#8230; you get the idea.
  * Try to **do more than one demo day.** Preferably in a very short amount of time. At 500 Startups, we run our accelerator cohorts through four separate demo days within a ~10 day period on both coasts of the US. Not only does it expose the startups to a broader range of investors but it creates a sense of pressure for the investors in the audience (&#8220;hmm&#8230; I better go talk to these founders because they&#8217;re about to see 200 more investors tomorrow&#8230;&#8221;).
  * This probably goes without saying but try to **limit the booze until the pitches are done**. Enough said.
  * For the love of all that is holy, make sure the *right* people are coaching your presenters. (Hint: they&#8217;re probably not your event sponsors.) **Bring in successful founders that have raised money &#8212; they&#8217;ll have the most relevant advice.** Maybe a few investors that have made *multiple* investments in the past few months.

Raising money is getting tougher: more startups from all over the world are competing for a finite pool of investor money. Founders need to tell crisp stories and make the most of the 2-3 minutes attention spans. Event producers need to create useful events that attract the* best* people from both sides of the table. Hopefully some of these tips are helpful.
