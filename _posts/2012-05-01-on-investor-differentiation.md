Earlier today, VentureBeat wrote about <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/05/01/the-dirty-secret-behind-the-incubator-boom/" target="_blank">the dirty secret behind the incubator boom</a>. Francisco raises an important point: other than initial money, what do these incubators bring to the table? The broader question is, what value do *all investors* bring to the table? As access to early stage deal flow opens up to more potential investors (see: <a href="http://angel.co" target="_blank">AngelList</a>), investors are being forced to prove their value. Especially if you want to get into the best deals. <!--more-->

For early stage investors, differentiating on access to capital is no longer enough &#8212; **focus on building a solid brand**. As my partner Dave recently <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/davemcclure/status/196280586309091328" target="_blank">tweeted</a>:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1100" title="Screen Shot 2012-05-01 at 4.05.33 PM" src="http://www.resultsjunkies.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-01-at-4.05.33-PM.png" alt="" width="508" height="148" />][1]

At <a href="http://500.co" target="_blank">500 Startups</a>, I&#8217;d like to think that our founders see us differentiated via the functional expertise that we bring to the table. (Though, I suspect a number of them would argue that our ability to throw good parties is differentiation enough&#8230; but I digress.)

We&#8217;ve spent an incredible amount of time building a network of <a href="http://500.co/mentors" target="_blank">150+ mentors</a> with expertise with data, design and distribution. More recently, we&#8217;ve been building tools to help our network of 500+ founders and 150+ mentors connect with each other via discussions, office hours and other events. We even have a full events team that helps us build thought leadership within the verticals that we invest in &#8212; that&#8217;s directly useful to our startups via access to investors, companies and other smart folks that care about those same verticals.

If you&#8217;re an angel group, I&#8217;d bet good money that your brand is probably something along the lines of &#8220;a bunch of people that move slow and/or never make a decision.&#8221; If you&#8217;re an angel investor or VC fund, it&#8217;s not uncommon to be lumped into the &#8220;dumb money&#8221; category.

At the end of the day, your brand isn&#8217;t what *you* think it is&#8230; **your brand is what *founders* think it is**. If you&#8217;re an investor (or even thinking about getting into the game), please understand that your brand is *the most important thing* you should build and protect.

**The smartest founders in the world will have no problem raising any money, make sure they want *your* money.**
