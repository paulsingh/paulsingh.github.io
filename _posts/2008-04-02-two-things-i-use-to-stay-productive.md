I was catching up with an old friend yesterday and we started talking about how busy our respective circle of friends had become over the last few years. &#8220;You probably wouldn&#8217;t understand,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but while you get to do the <span style="font-style:italic;">cool</span> stuff, the rest of us seem to be stuck in the daily grind.&#8221;

Huh? Where&#8217;d that come from? What do I even say to that?

That got me thinking for a while. Then I realized that he saw me as the guy that somehow sidesteps trivial work and spends time on the &#8220;really important&#8221; stuff.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;ll be the first to call your ass out when you&#8217;re wasting time my time with asinine requests. At the same time though, I attack everything I do with two simple things:

**Prioritization.** Back in college, I knew people that could study, watch TV, play video games, shower and do 24362456 other things at the <span style="font-style:italic;">same</span> time. I hated those people because I was the guy that had to go sit in the corner facing the wall so I could actually focus on my work.

To really [become effective][1], you should get into the habit of asking yourself &#8220;What needs to be done?&#8221; on an almost daily (if not hourly) basis. What I&#8217;ve learned is that I have to ask myself this question <span style="font-style:italic;">every time I finish something</span> because priorities can (and usually will) change once you&#8217;ve finished working on your most important tasks.

**Clarity.** I’ve found that just about project I&#8217;ve ever gotten involved in is too complex. And complexity is the enemy. We become confused and overwhelmed with too many possibilities and choices. Clarity is what we need &#8211; it gives us the power to focus on what really matters and say no to what doesn’t.

Next time you add a to-do (or even a larger project) to your list, make sure you clearly list what needs to get done. For example, rather than &#8220;Email Jack&#8221; you should probably write &#8220;Email Jack about tomorrow&#8217;s schedule&#8221; &#8211; those 3 extra words clearly define what you&#8217;re going to accomplish and go a long way towards getting things done.

So, give this a shot &#8211; it&#8217;s worked for me but I&#8217;d love to hear what you use to stay productive. Let me know.
