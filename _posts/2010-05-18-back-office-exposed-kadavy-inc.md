Here&#8217;s a quick interview I did with David Kadavy, &#8220;President and Owner of Kadavy, Inc., which is an S-Corporation that houses my web design consulting services, as well as media properties, such as kadavy.net, [Flatmate Meetup][1], and my share of [nom.ms][2].&#8221; He seems to have his hands in a bunch of stuff and I wanted to see how he manages to run it all without breaking a sweat.

**What is Kadavy Inc?**

Kadavy, Inc. is a Media company that I bootstrap with User Interface Design / User Experience consulting. The end goal is to <a href="http://www.kadavy.net/blog/posts/be-yourself-for-a-living-the-vision/" target="_blank">be myself for a living</a>.

**How did you get started?**

It all started with <a href="http://www.kadavy.net/blog/posts/my-first-blog/" target="_blank">a really simple, really meta blog post on a Blogger.com blog</a>, about 6 years ago. I wanted to share what I learned and encountered by following my curiosities day-to-day. Over time, opportunities to make money have come out of this.

**What tools do you use on a daily basis? **

  * 13&#8243; MacBook Pro
  * IKEA Jerker Desk
  * Wacom Tablet
  * Aeron Chair
  * Green Tea
  * VooDooPad
  * Google Calendar
  * Gmail
  * iPhone
  * Freshbooks
  * Google Docs
  * Google Analytics
  * Google AdWords

**Can you tell us a little about your backoffice infrastructure?**

I invoice using Freshbooks, which is great, but it&#8217;s a little awkward for keeping track of ad revenues from ad networks. I end up creating a client, emailing myself the invoice, and entering payment, whenever I get a payment from an ad network, such as Google AdSense. Since oDesk is one of my clients, I use their time-tracker when I&#8217;m working for them, and billing and payment is automatic. I also have to create &#8220;imaginary&#8221; invoices for them to get the data into Freshbooks.

**What were some of the biggest mistakes you made in growing your business?**

I can&#8217;t say that I would do much differently because it&#8217;s a long process, and &#8211; for my style &#8211; there isn&#8217;t any way around that. But, over time I&#8217;ve learned that every business has a product or service, customers, suppliers, and competitors. Really understanding the nature of all of these elements, and how they relate to one-another, works wonders in recognizing the difference between a weak business model, and a strong one.

**If someone wanted to start a business similar to yours, what advice would you give to them? **

Forget about money and follow your interests and curiosities. Share what you learn, and be thirsty to learn from others. If this isn&#8217;t enough to make you happy and fuel your patience in waiting for success, you should do something else. Also, this post on <a href="http://www.kadavy.net/blog/posts/the-way-i-work/" target="_blank">the way I work</a> may be of interest.
