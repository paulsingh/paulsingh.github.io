While watching TV last weekend, one particular commercial made me realize just how much the market is changing. Actually, it wasn&#8217;t really the whole commercial but a particular line &#8212; their tagline was &#8220;Lowest Cost of Ownership&#8221; and referred to Lexus&#8217; decent fuel economy, durability, and resale value.

That&#8217;s interesting because they used to run pre-Christmas ads for their &#8220;December to Remember&#8221; events featuring a loving spouse giving his or her significant other a new Lexus wrapped in a big red bow.

Even Hyundai&#8217;s doing it &#8212; in their most recent ad, they noted that the new Genesis sedan ($33K) has the same sound system as a Rolls-Royce Phantom ($300K+). &#8220;If you&#8217;d rather have money than a hood ornament,&#8221; goes the ad, the Genesis may &#8220;look even better than a Rolls-Royce.&#8221; *Nice. *

At the end of the day, the &#8216;I-buy-it-because-I-can&#8221; mentality is dead. No one wants to look like the idiot who bought something because it&#8217;s expensive anymore. **If you&#8217;re selling to this market, you should be focusing on practicality, value and durability. **
