> 1. Decide, before you start, that you’re going to change three things about what you do all day at work. Then, as you’re reading, find the three things and do it. **The goal of the reading, then, isn’t to persuade you to change, it’s to help you choose *what* to change.**
> 
> 2. If you’re going to invest a valuable asset (like time), go ahead and make it productive. Use a postit or two, or some index cards or a highlighter. Not to write down stuff so you can forget it later, but to create marching orders. **It’s simple: if three weeks go by and you haven’t taken action on what you’ve written down, you wasted your time.**

Next, take 15 minutes to read a short, **free** ebook on getting the most out of non-fiction reading, check out [How to Read a Book][4] by Paul N. Edwards.

That&#8217;s it &#8211; don&#8217;t waste another minute on your books. Use these tips to make sure you&#8217;re getting the most out of your investment.
