It&#8217;s interesting to think about how many small businesses get suckered into &#8220;branding&#8221; themselves before actually doing anything. The sad part: *I was one of them*. I had incorporated my first company many years ago and was feeling great. Nevermind the fact that I didn&#8217;t have a single sales prospect yet &#8212; I *had* to have a business card and other sales collateral. A few days later, I was a couple of hundred dollars poorer with boxes of shiny new stationary sitting on my doorstep. Suffice it to say, that business never went much further than that.

The lesson: **Building your business creates the brand.** The unconscious process of forming your brand comes out of unrelenting passion, not unending spin.<!--more-->

Ever heard of Starbucks? Contrary to what you may have heard or thought, Starbucks never sought to create a brand. Instead, the company passionately sought to create appreciation for a better tasting cup of coffee. It was, in fact, as basic as that.

Starbucks was too busy sourcing and roasting the highest-quality coffee beans to think about branding. Starbucks was too busy educating customers on how and why they should appreciate a stronger, bolder, more flavorful cup of coffee to think about branding. Starbucks was too busy creating a comforting and welcoming place for people to exhale than to think about branding.

Last week, I met [Ryan Moede][1] with [Viget Labs][2] (a web strategy firm based just outside of Washington, DC). He told me that before they accept a particular client, the Viget team asks themselves if they&#8217;d ever become employees of the client company. Unless the answer is yes, they won&#8217;t proceed. Rather than taking just any work that comes their way, they&#8217;re relentlessly focused on building their business with the *right* clients &#8212; the branding inevitably follows.

So, the first thing to do is to start ignoring all the &#8220;professionals&#8221; out there that advise you to spend hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars on &#8220;creating&#8221; a brand for your company. Instead, focus your efforts on being the best at what you do &#8212; the brand will follow.
