*This is the twelfth in a series of posts about the <a href="../blog/blog/some-lessons-i-wish-i-learned-earlier-in-life/" target="_self">lessons I wish Iâ€™d learned earlier in life</a>.*

There was a point in time when I absolutely had to have the latest gadget and try out the coolest new productivity hacks in my quest to get ahead. Looking back though, I can&#8217;t help but laugh at myself a little bit. I actually wonder how much time I spent reorganizing my personal &#8220;system&#8221; each time I tried something new &#8211; I bet it would be in the *hundreds* of hours.

**&#8220;So, what changed?&#8221;**

It was simple really: I realized that the majority of the successful people I knew relied on paper. **PAPER!** Not the latest iPhone. Not the latest GTD tool. Not the latest whatchamacallit. Just plain old paper.

**&#8220;What&#8217;s the big deal with paper?&#8221;**<!--more-->

[<img style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: left;" title="Todoodlist eBook" src="http://resultsjunkies.psd2live.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/125x125b.png" alt="Todoodlist eBook" width="125" height="125" />][1]First, go pick up a copy of [Todoodlist][1] and you will quickly see what I mean. It&#8217;s an easy read, you&#8217;ll get a few good chuckles and it includes a number of practical tips that I was able to use immediately. (One of the best things about it is the 30 day refund policy &#8211; so you have absolutely no excuse not to buy it. Just return if you really don&#8217;t get anything out of it.)

As I&#8217;ve said before, learning just *one* new idea from a book is the [best way to spend $20 today][2].

**&#8220;What system do you use?&#8221;**

Here are my tools of choice:

  1. [Parker Jotter Stainless Steel Ball Pen][3]<img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pausin-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000CD0XM0" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />
  2. [Parker Gel Ink Inserts ][4]
  3. [Moleskine Ruled Notebook ][5]

That&#8217;s it &#8211; three simple things that won&#8217;t go out of style tomorrow, won&#8217;t break the bank *and* never, ever need to be charged up.
