I built the original version of MailFinch, an <a href="http://www.mailfinch.com" target="_blank">on-demand direct mail platform</a>, in a few hours about six months ago. Today we&#8217;re sending a couple thousand letters a month and growing at a nice clip. Rather than give you hand-wavy advice about how you should do it, I&#8217;ll simply tell you how I did it.

### MailFinch Product Roadmap

**1) Core Product: Create Letter and Accept Money  
**

  * I wanted people to be able to upload a letter and send it.
  * Before they actually could send it, they need to pay me. Paypal made it easy to accept money on day #1. (Incidentally, I made my first sale about five hours after the site launched.)

**1A) Analytics **

  * Google Analytics is *free*. Install it.
  * Setup goal tracking. (In my case, the goal was to successfully create a letter and pay for it.)
  * Start reviewing the sender and recipients of each letter to see if a pattern emerges. (In my case, we collect physical addresses for both and we&#8217;ve got the sender&#8217;s email address.)

**2) Focus on Repeat Users: Same Users + More Letters = $$$  
**

  * Talk to users. (I can&#8217;t stress this enough.)
  * Review analytics. *Daily*. You&#8217;re looking for any patterns that appear &#8212; common email domains, common sender/recipient address attributes, etc.
  * Reach out to users that have sent more than one letter. Why are they using us? How did they do this before? What else do they want to see?
  * Prioritize bugfixes and feature requests by the amount of money a customer spends with you.

**3) Increase Traffic and Stickiness: More Users + Same Users = $$$!  
**

  * Once the core product is done (major bugs are dead, new features are coming/deployed), it&#8217;s time to think about how to grow. Do this by making the product stickier and/or increasing traffic. (Ideally, do both.)
  * Lightweight CRM capabilities &#8212; manage contacts, tasks, lists and campaigns from one portal.
  * Easy one-click contact importing via Highrise, Salesforce, Batchbook, etc.
  * Find as many local newspapers as possible. Start cold calling real estate agents and insurance agents that have a half-page (or larger) print ad &#8212; these people have money and presumably understand the value of direct marketing.

**3A) Analytics for traffic growth features**

  * A/B testing frameworks are nice, but expensive to setup. Focus on quick &#8220;deep dives&#8221; into your database to answer specific questions. (eg, for a user that has more than 1,000 contacts uploaded, how often do they login? How many letters do they send each day/week/month? How have they segregated their lists?
  * Basic cohort analyses are really helpful for tracking new user signups each week. They&#8217;re even more helpful when you know what new features were deployed on a given week. Use Excel, you don&#8217;t need anything fancy.

This road map isn&#8217;t designed to be some sort of checklist that you work your way through. Instead, you&#8217;ll probably find yourself doing the same thing I did &#8212; repeating #2 for while until it&#8217;s becoming clear that a real customer need exists. Item #3 is still a work in progress for me, we&#8217;re about halfway through that list of things but it&#8217;s looking pretty promising so far.

If nothing else, remember the core of this road map:

  1. **Launch the first version ASAP.** Ugly is fine, it just needs to work.
  2. **Start talking to *customers*. **Your mom/wife/dog is probably not a customer, go pick up the phone.
  3. **Repeat and Iterate.**

Now, go make some money.
