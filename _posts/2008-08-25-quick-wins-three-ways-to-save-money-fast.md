I&#8217;ve consulted a number of small businesses over the past few weeks and, unsurprisingly, they seem to be concerned about the same things that most of my non-entrepreneurial friends are: saving money.

Here are three tips for cutting your costs immediately:<!--more-->

  * **Ditch the underused gadgets. **Knowing exactly what you have is the first step &#8212; classify things by how often you use them. It doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated, simply look for anything that you don&#8217;t use on a daily basis. Some examples of this would be old cellphones, DSLR cameras that you don&#8217;t use every day, old computer monitors, extra laptops, unused printers and scanners. Sell or donate these immediately.
  * **Manual processes are your enemy.** Filing receipts, paying bills, checking voicemails &#8212; there&#8217;s no limit to the number of administrative tasks we have to deal with every day. If you haven&#8217;t already, get yourself a virtual assistant and start offloading tasks. Why do something yourself when you can have someone else do it for you, usually for less than $15/hour. (Check out the [Ultimate Virtual Assistant Guide][1] for more details.)
  * **Avoid overpriced (and unnecessary) contracts.** First, take a look at your cell phone bill &#8212; you&#8217;re likely to have many unused features on there that are eating you up. I call my cell phone company at least once a year and ask them to review my past statements to see if it makes sense to modify my contract in some way. Most times, a small adjustment to the minutes or SMS credits on the account will save me at least $20/month. For the rest of your contracts, use [the A La Carte method][2] to save yourself some money or simply renogitiate your contracts &#8212; there&#8217;s no harm in simply asking for a discount.

So, take a few minutes to try these out for yourself &#8212; the people I&#8217;ve talked to have saved at least a *few hundred dollars per month* and freed up hours of wasted time each week. All it takes is a few simple things to make it happen.
