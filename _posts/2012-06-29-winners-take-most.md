The top three links on the first page of most Google searches take ~60% of the overall clicks. (A quick search will show you a number of studies with more research.) I&#8217;d bet that these numbers probably hold true for internet startups as well.<!--more-->

If you&#8217;re building an internet company today, you&#8217;re *not* competing against the other team trying to build the same thing &#8212; you&#8217;re actually competing with all the noise out there.

Target a niche, launch the MVP early, iterate often and find product market fit as fast as humanly possible. After that, **focus on distribution** &#8212; [traction is defensible][1] and, more importantly, youÂ *need* to be within the top three products within your niche.

**The winners take most of the market, everyone else gets the scraps.**
