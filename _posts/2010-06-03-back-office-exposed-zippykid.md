  A few weeks ago, I realized that this site was running slow. <em>Really slow</em>. On average, it took ~3 seconds for any page to load. It was killing my SEO juice and I noticed that I was starting to lose readers left and right. I called my friend Vid immediately and he pointed me to his new service, <a href="http://zippykid.com" target="_blank">ZippyKid</a>. The results speak for themselves: <strong>I saw a 300% performance improvement once he took over this site</strong>. So, I asked him to tell me a little more about how it all works.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>How did you get started?</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Over past 3 years, I&#8217;ve noticed an increase in clients asking me help with their WordPress sites. I wrestled with outdated plugins and insecure configurations for ~30 sites before I started to notice patterns. Being a programmer, I automated the things I could and looked for tools to help me manage everything else.

    <strong>Tell us a little more about the tools you use on a daily basis.</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It can vary, but this is what you&#8217;ll find me using on most days:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      15 inch macbook pro
    </li>
    <li>
      iPhone
    </li>
    <li>
      Omnifocus
    </li>
    <li>
      Omnioutliner
    </li>
    <li>
      Netbeans
    </li>
    <li>
      Vim
    </li>
    <li>
      Github
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Can you tell us a little about your backoffice infrastructure?</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>/Git for version control, <a href="http://www.rackspacecloud.com/988.html" target="_blank">Rackspace Cloud</a> for hosting, <a href="http://chargify.com/" target="_blank">Chargify</a> for billing and custom scripts to install/update WordPress across multiple servers. Here&#8217;s how the magic happens (click for a larger version):

    <strong>What were some of the biggest mistakes you made in growing your business?</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I waited <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">365 days</span> way too long to launch the site. I kept thinking about all the things I thought I needed: a rock solid billing system, proper control panels, status monitoring, [insert 435820746254 other excuses here]. I should have started this a long time ago.

  <p>
    <strong>If someone wanted to start a business similar to yours, what advice would you give to them? </strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Don&#8217;t wait</em>. If you&#8217;re honest with your customers, they&#8217;ll understand and help you. I&#8217;ve told my customers that it&#8217;s just me and one person to answer emails, this helps manage their expectations and mine. I don&#8217;t promise 24/7 support, I promise fast loading, secure, and reliable websites.

    A couple things I noticed while talking to Vid:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      He&#8217;s a smart guy and has managed to avoid over-engineering the product. For example, he&#8217;s using an off the shelf billing system to avoid having to build it in-house (which, traditionally, is a <em>nightmare</em> to build and maintain). Notice that most of the workflow steps are manual &#8212; he hasn&#8217;t invested time/money into building anything fancy just yet. Instead, he&#8217;s proving that the business is viable before investing too much into it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Three words: Monthly Recurring Revenue. My favorite kind of business.
    </li>
    <li>
      The service and/or the process isn&#8217;t groundbreaking or new, he&#8217;s simply using his expertise to make his consulting life a little easier.
    </li>
  </ul>
