The most common phrase I hear from entrepreneurs is, &#8220;Get me to the next level.&#8221; Within a few minutes of chatting with them, it&#8217;s usually very obvious that they have a very real feeling of being stuck.

What &#8220;the next level&#8221; actually is varies depending on who you talk to but the good news is many of the factors that block reaching it are surprisingly the same. In almost every case I&#8217;ve seen, the elements that had fueled your earlier growth have run out or been forgotten.** You hit a wall.** ****

### There are no &#8220;magic bullets&#8221;

You need three things to keep your momentum going:<!--more-->

  1. **A system geared up for the next level.** Take a good, hard look at yourself today &#8212; are there manual processes or other tasks that can be automated, delegated or even ditched altogether? From Chapter 8 of [4HWW][1]: Refine rules and processes before adding people. Using people to leverage a refined process multiplies production; using people as a solution to a poor process multiplies problems.
  2. **Clear, specific and measurable goals.** You need to put your goals in writing and systematically review your actions to make sure you&#8217;re heading in the right direction. (Download this worksheet to help you define your goals and track your progress: [download#2#nohits])
  3. **Relentless execution.** Getting ahead doesn&#8217;t happen by accident &#8212; it takes hard work to get there. Accept this fact and simply move on.

Combine these three things and you&#8217;ve got everything you need to keep moving to the next level. Just remember, getting ahead is a marathon *not a sprint*.
