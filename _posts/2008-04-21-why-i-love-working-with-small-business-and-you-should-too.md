[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-25" style="float:left;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;" src="http://paulsingh.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/242259195_79b9bfc64e.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" />][1]Over the past few years, I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to work with a wide variety of businesses ranging from the Fortune 500 all the way &#8220;down&#8221; to small bootstrapped businesses (including my own).

I&#8217;ve noticed an inverse relationship between the size of the company and the &#8220;interesting-ness&#8221; of it&#8217;s employees. Simply put: **I&#8217;ve met the most interesting people at the smallest companies.**

&#8220;But Paul,&#8221; you might say, &#8220;everyone is interesting in their own way &#8211; what do you really mean?&#8221; Often, the only difference between an interesting person and one who does not consider himself interesting is a matter of confidence â€“ and a willingness to share their stories.

Small businesses are a unique place where employees have no choice but to be innovative and highly creative. When you tie those together with confidence and great communication skills, you tend to get the type of people that actively seek out (and share) new experiences &#8211; *that* makes them such interesting people.

When I was working with a large Fortune 500 company last year, the most interesting person I worked with was a horse breeder. Here at PBwiki, a much smaller company by comparison, I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to work with a helicopter pilot, influential bloggers, hot sauce aficionados, &#8220;hippies&#8221; (am I going to get in trouble for saying that?) and ex-librarians &#8211; a much wider range of people that all share the common traits above.

I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on this, especially those of you working in the &#8220;corporate&#8221; world. Let me know.
