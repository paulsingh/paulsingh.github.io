I have a secret: I tell people that I&#8217;m on vacation at least twice a month *and it&#8217;s usually a lie* because I&#8217;m actually just working from somewhere different to avoid distractions.

Yep, now my secret&#8217;s out but I&#8217;m not worried. I&#8217;ll continue using it because most people don&#8217;t want to be known as the person that bothers people on vacation.

Learn to take advantage of a distraction-free day and [work like your hair is on fire][1].

> Do nothing except finish the project. Hey, you could have been on vacation, so it&#8217;s okay to neglect everything else, to put your email on vacation autorespond and your phone on voice mail and to beg off on the sleepy weekly all-hands meeting and to avoid the interactions with those that might say no&#8230;
> 
> And then finish it. Finish the website or the manuscript or business plan or the suite of tools. No, this isn&#8217;t a great week to do outreach or make a pitch. That&#8217;s not the goal. It&#8217;s to finish that project that&#8217;s been stuck too long. Finish it or cancel it.

The key to using this strategy effectively is to make sure you don&#8217;t overuse it and ensure that the right people know what you&#8217;re actually doing with your time. At the very least, make sure that your boss and/or your clients know exactly what you&#8217;re up to.

Now go enjoy a full day of productivity and don&#8217;t forget to take an actual day off from time to time.
