****As I get older, I realize I&#8217;ve learned some lessons that I wish I had picked up sooner in life. Most of these lessons were learned through experience, many through the various mentors (Thanks, guys!) I&#8217;ve had along the way and a few from various books I&#8217;ve read here and there.

When most people today hear the word “lesson,” they usually don’t think of it as a good thing. Teaching a lesson may be looked at as being bossy or perhaps a know-it-all. While having learned a lesson may be viewed as a sign of weakness.

However, learning lessons is far from being weak. In fact, George Washington once said, &#8220;We ought not to look back unless it is derive useful lessons from past errors and for the purpose of profiting by dear bought experience.&#8221; Well said, sir.

Without further ado, here&#8217;s the list:

  1. <a href="http://www.resultsjunkies.com/blog/the-8020-rule/ " target="_self">The 80/20 rule</a>.
  2. [Parkinson’s Law][1].
  3. [Batching][2].
  4. [First, give value. Then, get value. Not the other way around][3].
  5. [Be proactive. Not reactive.][4]
  6. [Mistakes and failures are good][5].
  7. [Don’t beat yourself up][6].
  8. [Your attitude changes your reality][7].
  9. [Don’t compare yourself to others][8].
 10. [Worrying never gets you anywhere][9].
 11. [Don’t take things too seriously][10].
 12. [Avoid being technology&#8217;s bitch][11].
 13. There are opportunities in just about every experience.

In order to save you some time, starting next week and continuing each week, I&#8217;m going to highlight one of the lessons that you can focus on throughout the week.

Until then, why not send me a note and tell me about the lessons you&#8217;ve learned along the way. I&#8217;ll add the good ones to this list.
