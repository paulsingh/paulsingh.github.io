Like most people starting out in their careers, I was making chump change while trying to pay for school and figuring out what to do with my life. To be honest, I ended up wasting most of my money on overpriced (and *horrible*) food at school instead of accepting near-daily invitations to head out to lunch with a group of people from work. (My excuse was that I was saving money by avoiding real restaurants and that somehow hanging out with other college students would get me ahead in life &#8211; *fast*. What a joke.)

To make things worse, I was coming from an entrepreneurial family (seriously, every Indian family owns at least one business) and working for &#8220;The Man&#8221; wasn&#8217;t something I couldn&#8217;t handle for much longer.

I&#8217;m not sure what changed my mind, but I decided to accept one of the invitations to head out to lunch with the office. Boy, I wish I&#8217;d made that choice *way* earlier. I instantly realized a few things:<!--more-->

  * **It&#8217;s cheap. **Going out to lunch with the office wasn&#8217;t as expensive as I thought. In fact, the food was cheaper and tasted better.
  * **You&#8217;ll make new friends. **I immediately started associating with people that I never interacted with while I was at the office. Expanding your circle within the workplace is never a bad idea.
  * **Find out who&#8217;s who. **A casual environment tends to make people loosen up. It was easy to figure out who was committed to the company and who the chronic complainers were. (Tip: Be sure to keep your distance from the complainers when you get back to work &#8211; they&#8217;ll talk your ear off.)
  * **Get close to the movers and shakers. **Thanks to that casual environment, you&#8217;ll also form a rapport with your colleagues. And if one of your peers gets promoted, guess who she&#8217;s most likely to recommendÂ when other promotions come available? Yep, you got it &#8211; her favorite lunch buddies. It really is all about *who* you know!
  * **You&#8217;ll expand your circle. **Lunch was a cost-effective way of networking. Everyone wants to eat around the same time so we were surrounded by other local professionals.
  * **Know where you stand. **The fact that I was actually invited to lunch was a good sign. (If you&#8217;re not getting the invitations yet, take a look in the mirror and make sure you&#8217;re sending the right messages. My series on [rethinking your personal brand][1] will help you get started.)

Going out to lunch can not only be fun, but a valuable career tool &#8211; you never know who you&#8217;ll meet. I met two of my mentors and future business partners at one of these office lunches &#8211; that was the best $8 I could have spent. (Tip: Attend or Host a [Lunch 2.0][2] event in your area &#8211; it&#8217;s a great way to meet even more people.)
