If you&#8217;re an investor, it&#8217;s harder than ever to be a big fish in a small pond. If you can&#8217;t (or won&#8217;t) fund a company on fair terms, someone else will.

If you&#8217;re a founder, it&#8217;s harder than ever to raise money on a mediocre idea. After all, if I see a company with more traction halfway around the world, why wouldn&#8217;t I invest in it instead?<!--more-->

As much as AngelList has helped founders obtain capital from investors that may not be in their physical backyard, it&#8217;s important to recognize that AngelList has given investors the ability to see deals that used to be out of their physical reach.

What I mean to say is that we often hear about how useful AngelList has been to founders. What we don&#8217;t hear often enough is that AngelList also helps investors &#8212; **we get to see even more deals and, subsequently, the bar gets raised for any investments we end up doing**.
