As recently as five years ago, it wasn&#8217;t uncommon to see startups raising hundreds of thousands, if not *millions* of dollars, before they had a customer-ready product. Mostly, this was due to the high costs involved with internet startups (servers and bandwidth weren&#8217;t cheap). Things were expensive and you had to obtain permission from investors (via funding) to do any of it.** **

**Today, that barrier is almost non-existent.** Many founders are focusing on <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html" target="_blank">ramen profitability</a>, the cloud has significantly reduced infrastructure costs and open-source technology stacks have become incredibly powerful. Perhaps most importantly, it&#8217;s easier than ever for startups to *easily* collect revenue by building on top of easy-to-use APIs (Chargify, Recurly, CheddarGetter, etc). **<a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/09/lean-startup.html" target="_blank">Lean startups</a> FTW!**

If you&#8217;re a hacker trying to figure out what to work on next, please stop building the next Twitter, Facebook or [insert social-media-oriented-consumer-business-du-jour]. **Small businesses need your help** and they have money. *Lots o&#8217; money*. *With your name on it*.

**<!--more-->**

Consider this:

  * The majority of gas stations with convenience stores in this country are privately owned. These mom-and-pop stores are forced to buy franchise approved point-of-sale systems &#8212; that&#8217;s fine. The problem is that they all use a basic CRM/inventory management system to track store inventory and nearly everyone uses the one incumbent in this space. The product is terrible, it&#8217;s expensive, has no support *and they win because they simply showed up*.
  * Most (hair, beauty, nail, etc) salons know that their products (nail polish, shampoo, etc) are the highest-margin items in the store. As a rule of thumb, it&#8217;s almost always easier to sell something to a customer that has already purchased something from you. So why aren&#8217;t these salons cross-selling and upselling? *Because no one has made this easy for them.*
  * I get my hair cut every two weeks by the nice old man down the street. I&#8217;ve been going to him for years but, to this day, he only knows my first name *because I have to write it on a sign-in sheet* every time I walk into the store. Do I need to say more?

## Technology *is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">not</span>* the problem

It&#8217;s 2010 and finding smart people to build feature-rich applications for business is easy. NEWS FLASH: **business owners don&#8217;t need features, they want solutions to real business problems**. Help them turn tables faster, identify high margin items sooner, cross-sell and upsell customers easier. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">They will pay you for this</span>.

Salesforce.com is powerful CRM software (and they make a shitload of money) but most small businesses don&#8217;t care about 90% of the features. In 2010, **more features does not make a better product**. Your customers, business owners that just want to run their business, don&#8217;t care how cool your technology is or how many features you&#8217;ve crammed into your product. To them, **the interface is the product**. The successful business apps of tomorrow will take complex business operations and roll them up into beautiful, easy to understand applications that anyone can use. **Great user experience will be the differentiator**.**![][1]**

## *Smart* money is getting easier to find

It seems that nearly everyone with a little bit of money is <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/04/27/frothy-times-for-web-angel-investing/" target="_blank">itching to throw money at startups</a>. Unless you&#8217;ve been hiding under a rock, you&#8217;ve also noticed that discussions about [VCs, Dipshit Companies, And Super Angels][2] have been dominating the blogosphere lately. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessary to add yet-another-opinion into the mess, but here&#8217;s the point:

> Today, IPOs are practically non-existent, which means that **we all have to deal with the reality of smaller exits**.
> 
> To a VC, many startups are &#8220;dipshit companies&#8221; because they can never get to a scale that will generate &#8220;VC returns&#8221;&#8211;defined as a 10X return on a $5 million investment that buys you 1/3 of the company. For that to work, you have to sell for at least $150 million ($5 million X 10 X 3) and probably more.
> 
> But for a founder with a majority stake, a $25 million exit is life changing. Hell, a $10 million exit is life changing.
> 
> Layer in the fact that VCs go for a home-run strategy that results in no money to the founder in a super-majority of cases, and it&#8217;s no wonder that entrepreneurs are flocking to super angels like Dave.

**Everyone wants to invest but <a href="http://www.resultsjunkies.com/blog/what-is-smart-money-anyways/" target="_blank">founders prefer <em>smart</em> money</a> on good terms** &#8212; just having money simply isn&#8217;t enough anymore. &#8220;Dumb&#8221; money will increasingly be excluded from the earliest rounds to make way for &#8220;smart&#8221; money (probably via <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hiresfund.html" target="_blank">high resolution fundraising</a>) &#8212; **investors who bring connections, domain knowledge and *functional* expertise will win**. That&#8217;s good news for founders but bad news for (most) investors.

## Traction is hard to define for B2C, but much *easier* for B2B

Traction in consumer internet companies is *roughly* defined by eyeballs and actions. B2B startups focused on solving real problems have it much easier &#8212; they have customers (other businesses) that will pay good money for products *that solve real problems*. Traction in these deals is much easier to find: **B2B companies either have paying customers or they don&#8217;t**. If you can&#8217;t get a customer to pay you for your product, you <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/06/pivot-dont-jump-to-new-vision.html" target="_blank">pivot</a>. Repeat this until you figure it out or realize that you&#8217;re solving the wrong problem. (Contrast this to a consumer product where each pivot is usually followed by a long period of trying to pull in enough traffic to figure things out.)

If you hang around tech blogs long enough, you&#8217;d think that being a startup is about creating the next Google, Twitter or Facebook. That&#8217;s all well and good, but **the biggest opportunity lies in solving real problems for &#8220;traditional&#8221; brick and mortar shops** &#8212; the companies that *haven&#8217;t* seen innovation in many years (speaking from experience: <a href="http://www.mailfinch.com/" target="_blank">MailFinch</a> and <a title="simple, secure mobile notary public management software" href="http://notarycrm.com/" target="_blank">NotaryCRM</a> are two good examples of this). *This is awesome* (read: **huge opportunity**).
