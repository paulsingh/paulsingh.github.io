<span style="font-style: italic;">This is the sixth in a series of posts about the <a href="http://www.resultsjunkies.com/blog/some-lessons-i-wish-i-learned-earlier-in-life/">lessons I wish I’d learned earlier in life</a>.</span>

I&#8217;ll admit it, I&#8217;m a perfectionist. I spend way too much time trying to make sure that everything is just right (read: perfect) before I show it to anyone. Besides the fact that I waste precious time beating myself up over trivial things, I&#8217;ve learned that there is a huge benefit to pushing things out quickly to see if they even work. **It&#8217;s called the art of failing fast.**

A fascinating New York Times article on [the many errors in thinking about mistakes][1] explains why we all tend to avoid mistakes in the first place:

> We grow up with a mixed message: making mistakes is a necessary learning tool, but we should avoid them.

The problem is the vast majority of us (myself included) were probably raised this way, so encouraging us to embrace failure is &#8211; gasp!! &#8211; blasphemy. **Get over it.**

The same article continues:

> “We get fixated on achievement,” he said, but, “everyone is talking about the need to innovate. If you already know the answer, it’s not learning. **In most personal and business contexts, if you avoid the error, you avoid the learning process.**”

Here&#8217;s what you can do today: Recognize that old habits die hard and make the decision to be more open to — or less afraid of — making mistakes. Then, just get started.
