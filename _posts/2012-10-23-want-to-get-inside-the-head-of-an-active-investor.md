I&#8217;ve been an employee, I&#8217;ve been a founder and now I&#8217;m an investor. (In that order, actually.) When it comes to time-based experience, I&#8217;m still a noob &#8212; I&#8217;ve been on this side of the table for about three years now. However, what I lack in time, I&#8217;ve more than made up for in experience &#8212; 500 Startups&#8217; approach to high volume early stage investing and selective follow-ons has exposed me to hundreds of investments in a very short amount of time. It&#8217;s fair to say that **we&#8217;ve seen more startups in the past two years than most investors will likely see in a lifetime**.<!--more-->

As a result, everywhere I go, I often run into the same questions:

  * What are common mistakes that founders make when they pitch an investor?
  * Do you ever get used to saying &#8220;no&#8221; to founders?
  * Why is your beard so epic?
  * What questions should I ask investors to build trust, uncover hidden problems, overcome objections and speak to desires?
  * What&#8217;s Dave like in real life?
  * What is the most effective way to follow up with investors that are slow to decide (or have previously said no)?
