Life is short. Too short to not enjoy yourself, both at work and at play.

I know what you&#8217;re thinking (because I used to think the same thing): Life can&#8217;t always be fun and games. True. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t take roll with the punches.

Besides, no one&#8217;s ever been on their deathbed and wished that they had worked harder.<!--more-->

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-283 alignleft" style="margin-right: 5px;" title="Why so serious?" src="http://www.resultsjunkies.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/2740640431_779ef0b03d-193x300.jpg" alt="" width="193" height="300" />][1]Most people think that work is not meant to be fun, and those are the same people that work themselves into the ground, stress themselves out, and end up absolutely miserable (if you think stress in your work life doesn&#8217;t find its way into your personal life, you&#8217;re sadly mistaken). Trust me, I&#8217;ve been there.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The next time you&#8217;re feeling overwhelmed at work, stop and take a breather. Go joke around with a coworker. Leave early and spend some time with your family. Do whatever it takes to lighten your mood, and you&#8217;ll get back to work feeling refreshed and ready to take on the world.

The key to a well lived life is to avoid taking things so seriously. Just accept that unexpected things are going to happen and have a good time along the way. Besides, unexpected problems are rarely as bad as they actually seem.
