Do you know what you&#8217;re going to do with it?

A few weeks ago, my friend Ramit quoted me when I said that [books are the most cost-effective way to invest in yourself][3]. If you buy one book per week, for $20 each, that’s $1,000 per year. **If you get one good idea per week, it’s worth it.** It&#8217;s true &#8211; you could spend thousands of dollars for a semester of classes or no more than $20 for a book that you can read in a weekend. Which would you rather do?

Now, just imagine if you could learn just *one* new idea from the book and then actually apply it the next day. How much do you think that might be worth? (Answer: a whole hell of a lot.)

I&#8217;ll keep things simple for you, buy these two books today and start reading this weekend. I&#8217;ve recently read them and can tell you that you won&#8217;t need more than 4 hours to quickly read through both:

    Once you&#8217;re done, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll have atleast one new idea you can try at work (or school) the very next day. <strong>It&#8217;s that simple, just get started.</strong>
