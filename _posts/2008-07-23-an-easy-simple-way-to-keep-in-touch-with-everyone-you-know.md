Over the years, I&#8217;ve picked up a number of contacts &#8211; people I&#8217;ve met and perhaps even worked with. The problem is that I&#8217;ve *utterly* *failed* at keeping in touch with most of them. Chances are, so have you.

Unfortunately, networking simply doesnâ€™t work this way. Relationships take time and getting to know people requires patience.

**Here&#8217;s how I spend no more than *30 seconds a day* keeping in touch with everyone I know:**<!--more-->

I set a daily reminder (I use [Remember the Milk][1]) to email atleast one person from my contact list every single day. It takes 30 seconds to pick someone at random and fire off a quick email to say hello.

Here&#8217;s an email I shot off just a few days ago:

> Subject: Saying hello & mastering the iPhone keyboard
> 
> Hey Ben,
> 
> Hope all is well and that you had a great time in Costa Rica. (From the look of the pictures on your blog, it sure looks like you did!)
> 
> I dropped into a post today that reminded me of the brief conversation we had about mastering the iPhone keyboard, thought I&#8217;d pass it along: http://blog.crankingwidgets.com/2008/06/12/iphone-keyboard-mastery/
> 
> In any case, just wanted to say hello. I appreciated your time on the phone a few weeks ago &#8211; if there&#8217;s anything I can do to return the favor, please let me know.

Ok, so now you know how I do it, so let me give you one more tip: **Do your recipient a favor.** (See how I passed along a blog post that was relevant to our conversation from a few weeks ago?) As they say, it&#8217;s better to give than to receive. Consider each favor an emotional deposit. When it&#8217;s time to call in a favor of your own (whether it be help finding a new job or an industry expert that you might need some insight from), you&#8217;ll thank me.
