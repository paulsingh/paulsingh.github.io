<h1 align="center"><strong>Results Junkies Brain Trust</strong></h1>

<p align="center"><b>a private community of people getting shit done.</b></p> 

<p>As I criss-cross the country in my Airstream this year, I've had the opportunity to meet thousands of extremely motivated bootstrappers and venture-funded entrepreneurs. As I drive away from each city, I can't help but think about how I might be able to keep providing value to these local communities on an ongoing basis. More specifically, how Results Junkies could truly be an API for these local communities to tap into venture capital, functional expertise and quality programming without having my Airstream parked in their city every day of the year.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I’m creating a new invitation-only community platform for the people I meet along my tech tour this year. I’m calling it the Results Junkies Brain Trust.</p>

To start, I'll keep it simple:

* **Weekly video chats for you** (probably via Google Hangouts or Blab). Whether I pull another VC/angel on to the call with me or take questions from you, the ultimate goal is to make sure you get actionable / tactical tips for your businesses while also introducing you to well-known investors from around the country. I know building your business can be time consuming (and sometimes challenging). My bet is that connecting with your peers around the world can help ease the burden.
* **Integration into any of the stops on the Results Junkies Tech Tour.** One of the best parts of the tech tour has been spending up to a week at a time learning about the opportunities and challenges of building companies in various parts of the country. I’d love to have you (or your staff) join us in various cities where you’ll be able to impart your learnings for the local audience of founders, investors and policymakers while also picking up learnings that might be helpful when you head home. 
* **Opportunity to tap into partnerships and programming.** One of the challenges for founders/entrepreneurs is tapping into the benefits of corporate sponsorships and events/tours like ours. I want to offer you access to some of the best partnerships and perks for your team and members. Not every opportunity will be a perfect fit for every company, but at the very least, you’ll get the chance to opt in. No pressure - if it’s not for you, feel free to say no thanks.

<p>Similar to the tech tour, this is a work in progress: I don’t expect this community-building effort to be perfect on the first try but my hope is that you’ll help me iterate the offering until it’s something that adds a tremendous amount of value to you, your peers and your community.</p>

<p>If you're ready to pull the trigger, fill out the form below and you'll receive next steps via email immediately. <b>It's $29/month -- no bullshit, no spam and you're free to cancel anytime.</b></p>
