**What I Do**

TL;DR: I'm a dad, entrepreneur, speaker, investor and Airstreamer. Previously: Managing Director @1776, Founder @disruptioncorp (acq by @1776), Partner @500Startups, EIR at USCIS / DHS. **Say hi, I'm (usually) nice.** (If you're looking for headshots, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UstcfltnzawY_8o4AuSeF_ZDib4hpTAjjoEFsQ7pbcs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">find them here</a>.)  USCIS / DHS.

### **Projects**

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">After building Dashboard within 500 Startups, I spun it out into a company called Disruption Corporation in early 2013. In addition to building products such as Dashboard and Hubble, Disruption Corporation also managed the Crystal Tech Fund and partnered with Vornado to help "kickstart" Crystal City, VA.</span> Disruption Corporation was acquired by 1776.

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I am a Partner at 500 Startups. Founded in 2010, we&#8217;re headquartered in Mountain View, CA but have offices and staff in multiple cities around the world. We usually invest in 150+ new companies every year. We&#8217;re kind of a big deal.</span>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I built <a title="Startup Metrics (For Pirates) Made Easy" href="http://dashboard.io">dashboard.io</a> to help make the startup world a little more transparent&#8230; if you&#8217;re a web startup, you just install my javascript snippet on your site and relax. I&#8217;ll build you an AARRR table and show you how it compares to other startups in your industry. No fuss, no mess. Dashboard will be back soon&#8230; I&#8217;m cooking up something special at 500.</span>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I *hate* having to wait on hold when I call a company, so I built <a href="http://www.fastcustomer.com" target="_blank">FastCustomer</a> to save me some time. Just tell <a href="http://www.fastcustomer.com" target="_blank">FastCustomer</a> which company you want to talk to and we&#8217;ll call you when we have an operator on the line &#8212; usually within 5 minutes.</span> FastCustomer was acquired by Final.

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I have a few friends that do mobile notary stuff (also called &#8220;signing agents&#8221; if you know the lingo) and noticed they track everything via ghetto spreadsheets and email. I built <a title="Notary CRM Software" href="http://notarycrm.com/" target="_blank">NotaryCRM</a> to make their lives a little easier and more profitable. I launched the MVP in mid-July 2010 and, within a few days, managed to get a few core users that depended on the software every day to manage over $100K of their business.</span> I wasn't able to maintain NotaryCRM and have temporarily shut it down.

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Snail mail can be a bitch &#8212; especially if you do any kind of direct mail. So, I built <a title="On Demand Direct Mail" href="http://www.mailfinch.com" target="_blank">MailFinch</a>. Each month, we send thousands of pieces of mail so that our customers (mostly real estate agents, insurance agents and attorney&#8217;s offices) can focus on what they do best. We&#8217;ve got everything you would expect from today&#8217;s direct mail solution: contact, list and campaign management, drip campaigns, guaranteed next day mailing, sexy paper and a nice heaping spoonful of awesome.</span> MailFinch was shut down in late 2010.

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I recently launched something I&#8217;ve been working on: it&#8217;s a new type of RSS feed reader that is built around the way you <em>actually</em> read feeds. It allows you to rate items you find most interesting, learns what you like (and dislike!) to read and immediately begins to help you sort through thousands of articles, blog posts, Twitter feeds and filters out less interesting materials. In a nutshell, it saves you time by focusing your attention on the items you actually want to read.</span>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I call it <strong><a href="http://www.philtro.com">Philtro</a></strong> and it&#8217;s available now.</span> Philtro was acquired by CityVoice.
